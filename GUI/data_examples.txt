	TIRADS

	Right:

		1
		Anterior middle right thyroid, measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.3 cm (previously measures 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.5, with decreased appreciation of solid component) which is almost entirely cystic and macrocalcifications

		2
		Upper pole circumscribed cystic solid and spongiform nodule with a few colloid crystals is stable measuring 1.7 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm, previously 1.6 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm

		3
		Right mid thyroid solid greater than cystic nodule measures 1.3 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm. Mildly hypoechoic.Partial spongiform appearance. Well-defined. Slightly wider than tall.

		4
		Hypoechoic circumscribed solid nodule appears smaller measuring 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.9 cm, previously 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.1 cm.

		5
		Very hypoechoic mid mass with microcalcifications measuring 23 x 14 x 18 mm

	Wrong:
		4, pred: 3
		Right inferior thyroid solid nodule measures 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.5 cm, partially calcified

		5, pred 4
		There is a heterogeneously solid, hypoechoic nodule in the posterior right lobe, measuring 1.1 cm in length x 1.3 cm in height x 1.2 cm in width, previously 1.4 x 1.0 x 1.1 cm. This nodule is highly suspicious



	ATA

	Right:
			Benign
			mid anterior avascular, likely cystic nodule measuring 5 x 4 x 6 mm  ; previously 5 x 3 x 4 mm .

			Mildly Suspicious
		The left lobe measures 1.4 x 4.4 x 1.1 cm. A predominately solid relatively isoechoic lower pole nodule seen with small areas of cystic change measuring 1.3 x 1.0 x 1.1 cm. The left lobe is otherwise homogeneous.

			Highly Suspicious
		ill-defined mixed echogenicity nodule with coarse and microcalcifications measuring 19 x 12 x 17 mm

	Wrong:
			Benign, pred: not suspicious
		0.8 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm predominantly cystic nodule with a few internal septations within the lateral inferior aspect of the thyroid lobe, stable

			Moderately Suspicious; Pred: Mildly Suspicious
		the slightly heterogeneous hypoechoic nodule in the superficial mid left thyroid measures 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm   .
