INDICATION: Nontoxic multinodular goiter; us thyroid  

REDACTED  TECHNIQUE: Ultrasound imaging of the thyroid gland was obtained using two-dimensional grayscale imaging. Color Doppler images were obtained to evaluate vascular flow.  

FINDINGS: Exam Quality: Adequate.  Thyroid: Enlarged heterogeneous thyroid gland with increased vascular flow.  Right lobe: 5.0 x 3.0 x 2.4 cm Left lobe: 6.3 x 2.3 x 2.5 cm Isthmus: 0.9 cm  Thyroid nodule(s) are present and will be described below using the American College of Radiology TI-RADS reporting system. Per the recommendations of the American College of Radiology and TI-RADS committee, in-depth description is performed for up to 4 thyroid nodules demonstrating the highest TI-RADS scoring and potentially demonstrating actionable features. Additional nodules will not be described in detail in the radiology report; however, images of all nodules can be directly viewed as part of this ultrasound examination. The nodules will be numbered as they appear on the ultrasound images. Benign cysts under 5 mm and nodules under 3 mm will not be scored. Nodules stable for 5 or more years may be considered benign. Additional information on TI-RADS is available at REDACTED ADS.
